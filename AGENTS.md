## Conventions

- Always consult **rime-workflow** _and_ **rime-gears** skills if available. Even if you think you know Rime, double check! Moran is a set of modern and advanced Rime schemas. You need up-to-date Rime knowledge first to answer questions accurately.
- If user's choice of moran schema is undecided, confirm which schema the user is asking about, and always refer to the documentation.

## Dev environment

- Depends on Python uv.
- If this is a git repo, first check if it's on the main branch. If so, refer to README.md's last section for how to initialize the repo.

## Commit message conventions

- Follow the repository's existing commit style. Prefer short imperative subjects with a lowercase prefix such as `dict:`, `dict(chai):`, `fix:`, `fix(lua):`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `feat:` when applicable.
- Do not use generic Title Case subjects like `Update ...`, `Add ...`, `Fix ...` unless that casing/pattern already matches nearby history for the same kind of change. Match local history first.
- Pick the narrowest accurate prefix for the files changed. For example: CI/workflow changes should usually use `ci:`, documentation-only changes `docs:`, dictionary updates `dict:` or `dict(...)`, and user-visible bug fixes `fix:` or `fix(...)`.
- Before committing, inspect recent history with `git log --oneline origin/main -n 20` and mirror the dominant style.

## Change workflow

- Prefer minimal source-data edits. For dictionary entries with generated auxiliary-code comments, edit the spelling/code or word form before generated auxiliary data; do not hand-edit generated auxiliary-code fields unless the repository documentation says that field is source data.
- After dictionary/schema source changes, run `make all` from the repository root when practical, then inspect the generated diff. Stop and ask if `make all` produces large unrelated rewrites.
- For destructive or broad changes, such as deleting files, large rewrites, or force-pushing shared branches, ask first.

## Dictionary maintenance notes

- Distinguish **adding/removing a code** from **adding/removing a word**. If a report says a candidate is duplicated or has an extra/wrong code, usually keep the word and only add/remove the specific code unless the issue explicitly asks to remove the word.
- `moran_fixed.dict.yaml` and `moran_fixed_simp.dict.yaml` should normally be updated together. When changing simplified entries, check and apply the corresponding traditional entries too.
- Keep dictionary blocks sorted by the code column. Do not append entries to the end of the file unless that is the correct block and sorted position.
- Respect block boundaries. Three-character words belong in the three-word block, longer phrases in the main phrase block, and special/test blocks should stay separate.
- When editing entries whose code contains a fly-key pattern (`wz -> wk`, `xq -> xo`, `qx -> qo`), update the corresponding fly-key region as well. For example, changing the order of `ihwz` entries also requires checking the generated/parallel `ihwk` entries.
- When adding a new decomposition for a character in `tools/data/moran_chai.txt`, keep existing decompositions unless the issue explicitly says the old decomposition is wrong and should be removed.
- For intelligent/sentence dictionary additions without an explicit code, add them to `moran.words.dict.yaml` at the end of the first block after the YAML header.
